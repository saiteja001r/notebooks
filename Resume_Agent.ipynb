Here's the feedback:\n\n* The Career Objective section should be replaced with a Professional Summary section that provides a brief overview of the candidate's experience, skills, and achievements. The current objective is too focused on the job the candidate is seeking rather than highlighting their strengths.\n\n* The SKILLS section should be categorized into technical skills, language skills, and soft skills to make it easier to scan. Some skills like GenAI, MLops, and Git could be elaborated with specific tools or technologies used.\n\n* The EDUCATION section is well-structured, but it would be beneficial to include relevant coursework, projects, or academic achievements to demonstrate the candidate's knowledge and skills in their field.\n\n* The CERTIFICATES section is impressive, but it would be more effective to include the dates of completion and a brief description of each certificate.\n\n* The LANGUAGES section is straightforward, but it might be helpful to include the proficiency level (e.g., fluent, conversational, beginner) for each language.\n\n* The PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE section is strong, but it would be more effective to use bullet points consistently throughout the section. Some accomplishments could be quantified to demonstrate the impact of the candidate's work. For example, instead of saying \"enhancing interactive user experiences and improving engagement metrics,\" it could say \"increased user engagement by 25% through the development of an AI-driven virtual assistant.\"\n\n* Consider adding a PROJECTS or PORTFOLIO section to showcase the candidate's work, especially in machine learning and data science. This could include personal projects, contributions to open-source projects, or relevant coursework.\n\n* The formatting and consistency of the resume are good, but some sections have inconsistent spacing or indentation. It's essential to ensure the resume is well-formatted and easy to read.\n* Consider adding relevant sections such as Achievements, Awards, or relevant Tools and Technologies used in the industry."
